<h1>Hacking WPA/WPA2</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project revolves around the exploration and exploitation of a WPA2 network, employing the capabilities of the aircrack-ng toolset. I am diving into the intricacies of WPA2 security protocols, aiming to gain insights and hands-on experience in identifying potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses within the network infrastructure. The aircrack-ng toolset, known for its effectiveness in assessing and penetrating wireless security, is instrumental in this pursuit.
<br />

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Aircrack-ng</b> 
- <b>Wireshark</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali Linux virtual machine ran on VMware.</b>

<h2>Lab walk-through:</h2>
